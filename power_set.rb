Instructions of the problems

Write a function that returns all of the sublists of a list or Array.

Your function should be pure; it cannot modify its input.

Example:

power([1,2,3])
# => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

=end

def power(s)
  #your code here
  # recursively, we start with empty set
  a = []
end
